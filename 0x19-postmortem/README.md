Postmortem: Service Outage of ExampleApp - September 4, 2024
Issue Summary
On September 4, 2024, from 14:30 to 17:00 UTC, ExampleApp experienced a service outage affecting our users worldwide. The impact was severe, with the main user interface being unresponsive for approximately 50% of users. This resulted in critical disruptions in accessing the application, affecting user productivity and leading to a 20% drop in daily active users during the outage.

Timeline
14:30 UTC: Monitoring systems detected a significant increase in error rates and latency across the application.
14:35 UTC: An engineer noticed the issue during routine monitoring and confirmed it through multiple internal tools.
14:45 UTC: Initial investigation focused on database connectivity issues, as error logs pointed to failed database queries.
15:00 UTC: Misleading investigation paths included examining the load balancer configuration and server CPU utilization, which showed no anomalies.
15:30 UTC: The incident was escalated to the Database Engineering Team for deeper analysis.
16:00 UTC: The Database Engineering Team identified a deadlock situation in the database caused by a recent schema migration.
16:30 UTC: The issue was resolved by rolling back the problematic schema changes and applying a temporary fix to the database configuration.
17:00 UTC: Service was fully restored and normal operation resumed.
Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the outage was a deadlock in the database resulting from an incomplete schema migration. The migration script had introduced new indexes without proper optimization, causing long-running transactions to block each other. The resolution involved:

Rolling Back: The faulty schema changes were rolled back to the previous stable version.
Configuration Fix: Adjustments were made to database indexing to prevent similar deadlocks in the future.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent such issues in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

Improved Schema Migration Testing: Implement a more rigorous testing phase for schema changes in a staging environment that mirrors production more closely.
Enhanced Monitoring: Introduce detailed monitoring for database deadlocks and performance metrics.
Review and Documentation: Update the migration and rollback documentation to ensure clearer guidelines for future changes.
Database Load Testing: Increase the frequency and scope of load testing to identify potential issues before deployment.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Implement additional monitoring for database performance and deadlocks.
Conduct a review of recent schema migrations and document any changes made.
Schedule a review meeting with the Database Engineering Team to discuss improvements in schema migration processes.
Update the application’s incident response procedures to include steps for handling database-related outages.
Humor and Diagram

“Turns out our database schema decided to play a game of ‘who can block who’—and unfortunately, it won. Lesson learned: Always test migrations thoroughly, or you might end up on the losing side of this game!”
