nfrastructure consists of a single server hosting all components: web server (Nginx), application server, and database (MySQL).
The website is accessible via the domain name "www.foobar.com," which is resolved to the server's IP address using DNS.
Communication between components happens over localhost (127.0.0.1) for security and performance reasons.

Roles of Components:

Web Server (Nginx): Acts as the entry point for user requests, handles HTTP traffic, and forwards requests to the application server.
Application Server: Hosts the application logic, processes requests from the web server, interacts with application files, and communicates with the database.
Database (MySQL): Stores and manages data required by the application.

Communication with Users:

The server communicates with users' computers over HTTP or HTTPS protocols via the internet.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Vulnerable to downtime if the server fails.
Downtime during Maintenance: Website/application may be inaccessible during maintenance tasks.
Limited Scalability: Unable to handle sudden increases in traffic beyond the capacity of a single server.
